keep-inventory-in-sieges: false
# This was originally a feature in the old SiegeWar, until Goosius (Main SW Dev) returned for a while and moved some mechanics from SW to TownyCombat.
# This feature partially still exists, but the radius of the keep inventory area is based on the location of any town's homeblock, instead of a Siege Banner.
# WARNING: only military nation / town ranked players which can score points in the siege will keep inventory on death in siege zones.

allow-pearl-in-besieged-towns: false
# This was originally a feature on EarthPol and never got implemented into SiegeWar because the Gooius (Main SW Dev) had left around the same time
# This feature will allow players to teleport in towns that are in an active siege zone while ignoring the Town's Flags that would otherwise deny it.

spawn-trap-prevention-in-capitals: false
# This was originally made for EarthMC to prevent nation spawn trapping where a player would be in a surprise pvp zone.
# This feature was updated to work with SiegeWar at the request of EarthPol's Devs. This was originally mostly written by @Warriorrrr.
