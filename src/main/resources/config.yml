# TownyTweaks is an addon plugin for the Towny plugin.

# You will find almost every feature that isn't in Towny here and you can always enable or disable it!

# If one of the features TownyTweaks offers ends up added to Towny, it is recommended that you turn the feature off in this config
# and configure the feature in the main Towny config file (/plugins/Towny/settings/)

# Set to false to allow armor stand interaction anywhere, as long as the manipulator has permissions to the plot the stand is in.
# Set to true if you want the opposite, configure it below.

allow-armorstand-only-in-plottype: "edit-plot-type-name-here"
# Change the "edit-plot-type-name-here" to the name of the only plot type you want armor stands to be interactable with in.
